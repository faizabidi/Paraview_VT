This repository contains some basic code to connect to 
HPC servers at Virginia Tech, connect ParaView with the servers,
upload a scene file, etc. At the time of writing this documenation, ParaView
5.2.0 was not installed on the cluster. Thus, I had it installed in my home
directory. Please load ParaView 5.2.0 module if it has been installed on the
clusters by then. Else, install it in your home directory.

Most of the code in here is on how to use ParaView locally in Hypercube
since that was most needed at the time of making this repo but can be
extended to use the HPC clusters instead for rendering. 

A working demo was given to Nicholas to make sure everything in here
works. Thus, this is tested code.

Refer to the READMEs for more details and contact me if any questions.
